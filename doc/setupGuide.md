# Ipmlab Setup Guide

Before trying to set up Ipmlab, check if the following requirements are met:

* The installation platform is Microsoft Windows (tested with Windows 10). Other platforms (e.g. Linux-based one) will not work properly, because various parts of the code are Windows-specific.
* Python 3.8 (or more recent) is installed on the target platform. Older 3.x versions may (but are not guaranteed to) work.
* A licensed copy of the [IsoBuster](https://www.isobuster.com/) software (which is used by Ipmlab for to do the actual data extraction).

Getting Ipmlab up running requires a number of installation and configuration steps:

1. Install Isobuster
2. Configure Isobuster to make it play nicely with Ipmlab
3. Install Ipmlab
4. Configure Ipmlab

Each step is described in detail below.
